## Functionality
The crawler downloads speeches from the official Bundestag website in regular, customizable intervals.

The speeches are processed through seperate executables and the returned results inserted into the P2P network for indexing.

## External Specifications
### MongoDB speech document
The crawler connects to a MongoDB database for easy access of extracted speeches for the frontend. The document representing a speech is defined as follows:

```json
{
    // This ID is automatically generated by the crawler, as the official data source does not provide unique IDs for all speeches provided. This is a GUID as per GUID4 specification.
    "id": "uuid",

    // Title of the speech.
    "title": "string",
    
    // The name of the speaker.
    "speaker": "string",

    // Affiliation of the speaker. This can be his/her role in the Bundestag or for example his party.
    "affiliation": "string",

    // Date of the speech in a ISO 8601-1:2019 String Format.
    "date": "Date in ISO 8601-1:2019 String Format",

    // Entire processed content of the speech.
    "text": "string"
}
```
